Script Extender Version 60 from Norbyte: https://github.com/Norbyte/ositools/releases
The official download is unfortunately only an "updater" dll, not the extender itself.
This updater only works:
- 1) when strating the game with internet access (without internet you can not play, because even if the updater already downloaded the latest version, it wont let you play without internet)
- 2) only works when owning a legit copy of DOS2 (which is good in general)
- 3) as long as the updater can get the extender files, who knows when/if any server close down.
- 4) this server may be target of attackers and downloading malicious files when starting the game

Therefore I decided to upload the real extender dll here. It was created by Norbyte and I downloaded it by using the updater end of 2025.
Put the Dll files to "Divinity Original Sin 2\DefEd\bin", when starting the game you should see in the main menu the text that extender v60 is active.
For Linux see instructions at the official github from Norbyte.
