Mods for Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition made by me (Serp).  
The folders contain the source and the pak files can be used as mod.  
Most likely all my mods require the Script Extender at least v60 (thanks Norbyte for creating it): https://github.com/Norbyte/ositools/releases (automatically updates to v60 when launching the game, if you have internet and a legit copy of the game), with help of it my mods are most compatible to other mods, because they only change the single value they should change, instead of overwriting a complete skill or so.  

Some mods may contain work from other modders, this is mentioned in the meta.lsx/Mod Description. I wont upload these mods mod websites without permission.  
Most other mods will also be uploaded here, once I consider them finished: https://www.nexusmods.com/profile/Serpens66/mods?gameId=2569  

Many thanks to "Pip" the author of the incredible great QoL mod Epip: https://www.pinewood.team/epip/#download-links , he answered alot of questions about divinity modding in the Larian discord channel.
