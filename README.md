Mods for Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition made by me (Serp).  
The folders contain the source and the pak files can be used as mod.  
Most likely all my mods require the Script Extender at least v60: https://github.com/Norbyte/ositools/releases , with help of it my mods are most compatible to other mods, because they only change the single value they should change, instead of overwriting a complete skill or so.
