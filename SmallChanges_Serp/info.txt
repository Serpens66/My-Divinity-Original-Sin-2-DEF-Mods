A collection of small gameplay changes written in lua, so fully compatible to other mods.

[list]
[*]Immortal Segeant and Gwydian
[*]add MadnessImmunity and CharmImmunity to the Indomitable status
[*]Improved DoorOfEternity: targets all allied summons, lasting 5 rounds
[*]ViableGateway: using the Planar Gateway only costs 1 AP, can be used 10 times and lasts 4 turns. The skill to cast it costs 3 AP, no SourcePoints, 10 turns cooldown.
[*]Infinite SpiritVision
[*]InnateBless: Bless and Curse do not cost a memory slot, you get both spells at the same time and they cost 2 AP but no Source Point and 5 turns cooldown.

[*]necromancy nerfed from 10% to 7% (SkillAbilityLifeStealPerPoint)

[*]Improved grenades: Scaling with Finesse now. Halfed weight, reduces AP costs by 1 for non-damage grenades, trippled DamageRange, so damage is more random but could be higher. (based on idea of mod "Make Grenades great again")
[*]make every summoning skill require at least in Summoning ability 1
[*]When having at least level 3 of Summoning, you get the BeastMaster talent which gives +1 to active summons.
[*]reducing LoreMaster from most NPCs by 2 (except traders with Repair value), so its less likely they know your stats.
[*]make Spears scale with Strength instead of Finesse
[*]make Food Stati last 3 times longer.
[*]give every player character the InventoryAccess talent, so swapping equipment during a fight is cheaper.
[*]disable the Indomitable Talent, use my Balanced Indomitable for All mod instead.
